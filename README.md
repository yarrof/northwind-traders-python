## What are you going to learn?

- Answer complex business questions using advanced SQL commands.
- Join database tables (`JOIN`).
- Use aliases (`AS`).
- Group results to use aggregated functions (`GROUP BY`, `COUNT`).
- Order rows (`ORDER BY`).
- Filter aggregated results (`HAVING`).
- Use some PostgreSQL specific aggregate functions (`ARRAY_AGG`, `STRING_AGG`).

## Tasks

1. Your first task is to create a query that shows which product is made by whom. Lists products and their suppliers. Display the `product_name` and the `company_name` of the supplier. Name result columns as `product` and `company` respectively. Order the results alphabetically by `product_name` and by `company_name`. Save the SQL query as `task-1.sql`.
    - The result of the query starts with the following lines.
```
     product      |           company
------------------+-----------------------------
Alice Mutton      | Pavlova, Ltd.
Aniseed Syrup     | Exotic Liquids
Boston Crab Meat  | New England Seafood Cannery
Camembert Pierrot | Gai p√¢turage
Carnarvon Tigers  | Pavlova, Ltd.
```
    - The result of the query contains seventy-seven rows

2. Create a query to reveal how many products are in each category. List categories and number of products. Join the `products` and `categories` tables. Name result columns as `category` and `number_of_products`, respectively. Order the results by the number_of_products descending and then by the category name. Save the SQL query as `task-2.sql`.
    - The result of the query is the following.
```
    category       | number_of_products
    ---------------+--------------------
    Confections    |                 13
    Beverages      |                 12

```
    - The result of your query contains eight rows

3. The Head of Sales wants to know which products are the ten worst performing. List product names and the total sum of the order values. Order the results by the `sum` column to start with the worst performing product. Save the SQL query as `task-3.sql`.

```
           product_name     | sum
